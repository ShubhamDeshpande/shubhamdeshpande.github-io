Academic Projects:
======
-
- Wink and Silence Expression Detection : 
    Programmed/trained OpenCV to detect ‘shh expression’ (silence) and a ‘wink expression’ in images and live video using HAAR cascade c     classifiers. Achieved 85%+ accuracy.
- 
- IMDB Analytics and Movie Recommendation System : 
     Implemented map reduce design patterns to derive statistics (movies, users, ratings) and designed a movie recommendation system;        Used Mahout and Hadoop/HDFS.
- Implementation & Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms : 
     Implemented in Java k-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Regression, Collaborative Filtering, ID3 decision tree, Perceptron, and            analyzed their accuracy using sample data. Performed error analysis on supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms          using WEKA.
